# qaf-cucumber
formator for cucumber runner

This class is cucumber formattor that can be used with cucumber runner to generate QAF reports when you are using QAF with cucumber. 

This is deprecated and provided for existing users who are using qaf with cucumber and using cucumber runner. Use GherkinScenarioFactory to take advantage of all QAF feaures like pallalel execution, run configuration, test-data factories etc.

With QAF-2.1.9 [QAF gherkin client](https://qmetry.github.io/qaf/latest/qaf-gherkin-client.html) supports feature files written in gherking syntax and steps with cucumber's step annotations (Given/When/Then) so you don't need to use cucumber runner for gherkin.
